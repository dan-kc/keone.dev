        For businesses that operate primarily outside of the web, one page is
        often all it takes to introduce and inform users about their products
        and services.
        <br />
        <br />
        An eye-catching landing page would establish your brand’s online
        presence and open you up to a huge set of potential clients who would
        otherwise be left in the dark!
        <br />
        <br />
        Single landing pages are very similar to portfolios in their design and
        development, but they may differ in terms of scope and content
        management. Portfolios may require multiple pages or integration with a
        CMS so that the owner can update their website with new works, but for
        many businesses, neither is necessary.

        Price & Timeframe
      </h3>
      <p className='mt-3 text-lg '>
        A landing page should cost between £4,800 and £7,700 and take about 5
        weeks to complete; however, as with the portfolio website, price and
        timeframe may vary depending on the scope of the animations implemented.
