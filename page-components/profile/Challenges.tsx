        More about me
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-3 text-lg'>
        A quirk of mine that my friends love to make fun of is that I'm always
        setting myself weekly, monthy and yearly challenges. For example my
        challenge for 2021 was no meat, and 2022 was no chocolate. My challenge
        for 2023 is no deep fried food and no United Kingdom - both very harmful
        to your health.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm also a junglist, a coffee snob, and a Super Smash Bros Melee
        enthusiast.
