        Why development?

      <p className='mt-8 text-lg '>
        I began programming in my maths degree at University of Bath, and after
        delving into some research papers on behavioural design while
        procrastinating my degree, I also became fascinated by the science behind
        excellent UX/UI.
        <br />
        <br />
        These interests in tandem abruptly steered my career trajectory away
        from finance and toward designing and developing engaging web
        experiences, inspiring me to spend three years learning the web and all
        of itâ€™s intricacies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Best decision I've ever made.
